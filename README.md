# Overview
Welcome to the Gaokerena Project! We’re excited to share an innovative initiative aimed at advancing natural language processing for the Persian-speaking medical community
Gaokerena is compact but powerful, designed to run smoothly even on home devices while keeping privacy and security—essential for medical use—at the forefront. We trained it on a new Persian medical dataset, including free-form Q&A, to make healthcare information more accessible and interactions safer.
AI has huge potential to improve medicine, and with Gaokerena, we’re working to bring that potential to the Persian-speaking world.

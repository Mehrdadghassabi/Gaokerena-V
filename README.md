# Overview
Welcome to the Gaokerena Project! We’re excited to share an innovative initiative aimed at advancing natural language processing for the Persian-speaking medical community
Gaokerena is compact but powerful, designed to run smoothly even on home devices while keeping privacy and security—essential for medical use—at the forefront. We trained it on a new Persian medical dataset, including free-form Q&A, to make healthcare information more accessible and interactions safer.
AI has huge potential to improve medicine, and with Gaokerena, we’re working to bring that potential to the Persian-speaking world.

# Features
- First Open-Source Persian Medical Model: The only publicly available Persian language model fine-tuned specifically for medical applications. making it freely available for research and other applications.

- High-Quality Persian Medical Datasets: Introduces the first-ever dataset in Persian for medical question answering, developed by our team from scratch, setting a new benchmark for Persian medical NLP resources. The dataset include:

    1. 90M-token Persian medical corpus (crawled from diverse sources).

    2. MF3QA: 140K+ filtered medical Q&A pairs (first free-form Persian dataset).

- Great Results: Stands out by delivering better results than other related models, including those that pair English medical models with translation systems. It excels at accurately interpreting medical questions and providing clear, reliable answers in Persian, making it highly effective for healthcare needs.

- Focus on Privacy and Ease: A lightweight model (based on aya-expanse-8b) optimized for local deployment, ensuring sensitive medical data remains secure and confidential.
